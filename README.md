# GlobSIP 16 - Ordered Weighted Averaging Layer

Image Aesthetic Assessment via Deep Semantic Aggregation

## Introducion

We proposed a new parameterized pooling layer - Ordered Weighted Averaging Layer to aggregate features from multi-column networks. We first sort features along specific dimension and multiply them with trainable weights to form a  aggregated feature. The parameters of the network are trained by end-to-end back-propagation technique. Results on the standard benchmark of aesthetic quality assessment shows the effectiveness of our approach.

## How to use ordered weighted layer

**Note**: we are now just providing CPU version, the GPU version is coming soon...

example :

	layer {
	  name: "aggregation"
	  bottom: "1st_pool5"
	  bottom: "2nd_pool5"
	  bottom: "3rd_pool5"
	  bottom: "4th_pool5"
	  type: "OrderedWeighted"
	  top: "aggregation"

	  ordered_weighted_param {
	  	OrderOp: DEX              // Sorted in ascending order or descending order
	    positive: true            // Force weights to be positive
	    axis: 1                   // The axis to aggregate
	    weight_filler {           
	      type: "gaussian"
	      mean: 0.5
	      std: 0.1
	    }
	  }
	}
